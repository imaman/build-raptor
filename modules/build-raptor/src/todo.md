- [x] The Run class (part of Driver) should check for execution of tasks using black-box techniques (i.e., stop relying on data reported by the SUT)
- [x] wipe out the output location of task before it runs.
- [ ] ~~pass build-run-id to each protocol method~~
- [ ] ~~move graph.walk() out of graph.ts~~
- [ ] ~~running core-test's use a different visual formatting for the inner tests (`===== <task-namne> =====`)~~
- [ ] ~~test: output is not recorded when the task fails.~~
- [ ] ~~test: restoreOutput gracefully returns when output is not found ? but maybe we should re-run the task (yes, the verdict was OK but we do not have the output)~~
- [ ] ~~introduce an AbsolutePath and RelativePath types.~~
- [x] pass unit ID to the protocol?
- [x] use the initialize()/close() methods of the protocol, thus avoiding the need to pass a factory to the driver?
- [x] protocol should pass a glob for each unit (not just a directory) to allow selecting certain files.
- [ ] the fingerprint should include the FP of the concrete protocol (in our own repo, when we change yarn-repo-protocol, and 'yarn self-build -u build-raptor-core' it will not be rebuilt b/c it does not have a dep. on yarn-repo-protocol).
- [ ] FP snould include the FP of all tasks that the current task depends on (tricky. how?)
- [ ] tests should be a separate unit.
- [x] allow build task to specify "top-down" semantics, which cancels execution of this task on deps.
- [x] add a root-cause task for short-circuited tasks
- [x] fine-grained re-run (HD rerun of tests)
- [x] each unit/task should have a glob to specify location of files - should affect the files that are fingerprinted
- [ ] colored output
- [ ] publish task
- [ ] promote task
- [ ] print a summary of the results
- [ ] add to the fingerprint all the code that is not in any unit
- [ ] protocol should offer methods to cast tasks strings to TaskId (similarly for unitId)
- [ ] repo-protocol-testkit should have a method that creates a standatd recipe (?)
- [ ] timeouts on invocations.
- [ ] reconsider the 'CRASH' status. It looks like we can just use an exception to indicate a crash.
- [ ] fingerprint of a unit should include the definition of its tasks.
- [ ] add a limit on number of output locations + on number of files in them + total size.
- [ ] denormalize taskrules into a per-unit task-spec.
- [ ] resolve all .skip()s in test files
- [ ] make it possible to cap the storage used by filesystem-storage-client
- [ ] debug: how come we do not have skip-on-main in the build-raptor's own repo?
- [ ] shard tests (of a unit) and run them concurrently
- [ ] regexp/substring on unit names in the CLI (-u foo.\*)
- [ ] safe outputting of values in exceptions
- [ ] mvn protocol
- [ ] python protcol
- [ ] gradle protocol
- [ ] javac protocol
- [ ] yarn protocol
- [ ] lerna protocol
- [ ] neither-lerna-nor-yarn protocol
- [ ] do publishing in github actions
- [ ] do promotion in github actions
- [ ] e2e which consumes docker form another package
- [ ] e2e test for s3-storage-client (s3-storage-client-testkit)
- [ ] the CLI respects the current directory: when running from X only runs tests of X.
- [ ] actions-cli should copy task outputs to a directory structure (as the CLI does)
- [ ] control the env variables passed to tasks
- [ ] CLI flag to control whether failed tasks are re-run. In particular. should default to "no-rerun" in dev machine mode.
- [ ] no re-run of failed builds. just failed tests.
- [ ] when not re-running failed tests, dump their logs directly to the console (as-if they were invoked).
- [ ] when trying to specify dist/tsbuildinfo.json as an output location (as oppopsed to just dist/) compilation becomes signfiicanlty slower (looks like no incremental comilation is happening, because build-raptor deletes it). dist/src+dist/tests is terribel because then there is a mismatch between tsbuildinfo and dist/src (or dist/tests) resulting in under compilation. using dist/ works, but then we can use dist/ for placing the outputs of other tasks (such as pack).
- [ ] when there is a task which decalres output location 'dist' and another one which decalres output-location 'dist-foo' build-raptor emits an "output collision error". apparently we compares prefixes instead of comparing path-segments.
- [ ] this error message is confusing: 'this build-raptor run has crashed due to an unexpected error Error: Output location <xdist-pack> does not exist (under </home/imaman/code/imaman/build-raptor/modules/build-failed-error>)'
- [ ] get rid of the --build-output-locations flag
- [ ] compute next version (with max on existing version) from npm reg
- [ ] e2e tests for yarn-repo-protocol
- [ ] trim size of log file, task output cache, fingerprinting audit log
- [x] get rid of the hasher-closed messages in the log.
- [ ] allow options to be read from a file.
- [ ] consider reintroducing caching of fingerprints (to avoid fingerprinting a directory that was fingerprinted earlier in the build run). Usually it is quite fast as is. Also, caching is tricky because output location need not be cached (a subsequently running task may change their content).
- [x] build when dep of dep changes
- [x] delete output files if source file is deleted

## Maybe TODO

- [ ] side-effecting tasks? e.g., running "npm install" (assuming it has a task of its own) is needed only if we are going to build something or run tests. if all the tasks that need to run are (say) promote then maybe we do not need to run "npm install"
- [ ] depend on verdict
- [ ] check content of output locations and restore them if does not match FP of sources?
- [ ] error propagation graph
- [ ] stop running tasks which are only needed for a task that already got a verdict?
- [ ] storage client should offer a stream-based API (?)
- [ ] storage-client (and task-store thast wrapping it) should offer a batch-query API (to issue multiple object-exists calls).
- transitive: do not run build in dep if is due to run at dependent
- separate tests build from application build

* task-name

==========

- modules/build-raptor-core/src/validate-task-infos.ts => testing of the reg
- fingerprinter.spec.ts - untodo
- modules/build-raptor-core/tests/minimal-testing.spec.ts - unskip
- planner.spec - test('when a task definition changes, the task will run', untodo

---

- --run-always
- custom jest output
- jestoutput to be part of the inputs
- distinguish between fingerprint of inputs and of output
- tasks that always run
- purge the local cache when it grows too large
- output should indicate concurrency
- stop calling lambda. dump a detailed JSON file so that user-code can then do whatever it wants with it.
- task-store: two things which have the same content but where compiled at different times should have the same blobid.
- rebuild when package.json changes
- support other test runners
- run -> test fails -> run again (only one test is exectued) -> change source code -> run (all tests should run)
- tree output should include also cached tests.
