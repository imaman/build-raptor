/**
 * Allows tasks (promises) to be executed with controlled concurrency, providing error-handling ("fail fast"), and notifications
 * that allow consumers to track progress. Uses PQueue as the underlying priority queue.
 *
 * The execution of a task is essentially calling the callback function passed to the copnstructor (`workToDo`), passing
 * to it a `T` value (`T` is a generic type, representing information about a single task).
 *
 * Fail-fast error handling: once a task is rejected, it is guaranteed that no further tasks will be execute. Tasks that
 * started running before the rejection will continue to run. Subsequent calls to `schedule()` are allowed but those
 * scheduled tasks will not be executed.
 *
 * Progress notifications: consumers can use `subscribe()` to register a handler that will be called whenever some
 * progress in made (including progress due to task failures, or tasks that are no-op due to a previous failure).
